Terminal Pomodoro Timer is a Python-based application designed for terminal users who wish to efficiently manage their time using the Pomodoro technique while also providing an option for meditation breaks.

## Mode Selection
*Focus Mode*: A traditional Pomodoro session. Typically it involves 25 minutes of uninterrupted work followed by a short break.
*Meditation Mode*: A mode designed to detach and meditate during breaks. The meditation sessions can also be timed, allowing users to have short to extended meditation periods.

## Time Trcking
The application records and displays the cumulative time spent in both focus and meditation modes by the end of the session.
